                       These roles have strengthened my adaptability, quick learning, and ability to apply transferable skills across different contexts.

                        <h2>Fish Husbandry</h2>
                        <p>As a Fish Facility Technician in a zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) genetics lab, I supported daily operations of a high-throughput aquatic research facility. 
                            I became well-versed in IACUC protocols and animal care standards in a laboratory setting. 
                            My responsibilities included culturing Artemia for live feed, administering specialized dietary plans, performing routine tank maintenance, and ensuring accurate, consistent documentation of animal care and facility conditions. 
                            This role deepened my understanding of responsible animal husbandry and the importance of precision and consistency in research support.</p>

                        <p>Besides going out to collect the conch, I also learned how to extract the micorplastics from their fecal matter. 
                            Following pre-existing protocols, organic matter was elimated from the samples, plastic particles separated from sediment via flotation,
                            and then filtered using a vacuum pump. The filter papers were then manually checked with a microscope to count the microplastics, 
                            and record characteristics such as microplastic type, size, and color using the AmScope image measurement software. </p>

                            There, I performed standardized procedures to collect morphometric data and tissue samples from various turtle species. 
                            I prepared turtle specimens for skeletal cleaning using dermestid beetles, ensuring proper handling and documentation throughout the process.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my experiences, I have had the opportunity to learn about the value of fisheries from a variety of stakeholders.
                           When I was an intern for the Southern Wisconsin Trout Unlimted chapter, I hauled logs on volunteer habitat restoration workdays with people from a variety of backgrounds
                           who were all brought together by their passion for trout conservation. 
                            
                           In northern Wisconsin, I learned about the cultural significance of Walleye.</p>

                        <h2>Other Experiences That Shaped Me and My Science</h2>

                        <p>After my internship with Center for Limnology ended, I was still super interested in fisheries. The PhD student was kind enough to take me on for a year of independent study. The topic was Bluegill Population Dynamics. This consisted in a deep-dive into 
                            bluegill reproduction. This was incredibly interesting to me, and is part of the reason why my research approach involves quantifying life histories of fishes. </p>

                        <p>To get through undergrad, I worked at one of the campus libraries. I was then promoted to a Student Lead where I managed and trained other students, performed building security checks,
                            and interacted with the public. I was also grateful to be a Mercille J Lee Powers Knapp scholar. I learned to uphold the motto "Excellence in Scholarship, Leadership, and Service". Through this program, I 
                            served as a peer mentor to incoming freshman in the program, as well as participated in a variety of ways to give back to the community, such as writing cards to patients during the Covid-19 Pandemic and doing a trash-pick up in the downtown area.
                            Mentoring was special to me, as I really value the idea of individuals helping the incoming cohort. Service was important to me as I think it is important to give back to your community, and the commuities you work with.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I was an active member in the Wildlife Society, Wisconsin Chapter of Conservation Biology Student Chapter, 
                           and the American Cetacean Society. These memberships showed me the importance of community in science.
