                        <p>I was a Fish Facility Technician for a genetics lab at the Univeristy of Wisconsin Madison. The lab was comprised of zebrafish (Danio rio).
                        Here, I learned about what IACUC protocols entailed in a lab setting. I raised artemia, fed specialized dietary plans, maintained the tanks, and consistently completed the necessary documentation of care.</p>

                        <p>Throughout my experiences, I have had the opportunity to learn about the value of fisheries from a variety of stakeholders. When I was an intern for the Southern Wisconsin Trout Unlimted chapter, I hauled logs on volunteer habitat restoration workdays with people who truly cared about trout. 
                            In northern Wisconsin, I learned about the cultural significance of Walleye.</p>

                        <h2>Other Experiences That Shaped Me and My Science</h2>

                        <p>After my internship with Center for Limnology ended, I was still super interested in fisheries. The PhD student was kind enough to take me on for a year of independent study. The topic was Bluegill Population Dynamics. This consisted in a deep-dive into 
                            bluegill reproduction. This was incredibly interesting to me, and is part of the reason why my research approach involves quantifying life histories of fishes. </p>

                        <p>To get through undergrad, I worked at one of the campus libraries. I was then promoted to a Student Lead where I managed and trained other students, performed building security checks,
                            and interacted with the public. I was also grateful to be a Mercille J Lee Powers Knapp scholar. I learned to uphold the motto "Excellence in Scholarship, Leadership, and Service". Through this program, I 
                            served as a peer mentor to incoming freshman in the program, as well as participated in a variety of ways to give back to the community, such as writing cards to patients during the Covid-19 Pandemic and doing a trash-pick up in the downtown area.
                            Mentoring was special to me, as I really value the idea of individuals helping the incoming cohort. Service was important to me as I think it is important to give back to your community, and the commuities you work with.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I was an active member in the Wildlife Society, Wisconsin Chapter of Conservation Biology Student Chapter, 
                           and the American Cetacean Society. These memberships showed me the importance of community in science.
